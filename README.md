## Overview

### The challenge
This is my proposal of solution to the QR code component challenge from Frontend Mentor website and my very first non-tutorial project in front-end carrer. 
The challenge consists of creating a simple static page using the jpg design file as reference and using only HTML5 and CSS3.

## My process

### Built with
I started by configuring the project folder. Then build the entire structure and content in semantic HTML. Finally I finished with the customizations in CSS3, always iterating the HTML file to create and adjust the necessary classes.

### What I learned
This was my first non-tutorial Front-end project, so everything was a great learning experience, however, I emphasize that the alignment techniques both with Flexbox and with display block and also relative and absolute positions were great learnings in this challenge .

### Continued development
I intend to continue carrying out the challenges of the Frontend Mentor platform, especially those initial ones that only require HTML and CSS and strengthen my foundations in these languages, while I'm still learning the initial concepts of JavaScript.

### Useful resources
These two games below helped me a lot to understand how simple commands in Flexbox work, in addition to being very fun.
